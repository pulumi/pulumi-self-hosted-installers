config:
  # Set the AWS region to deploy the infrastructure to.
  # This should be the same for all the stacks.
  aws:region: us-east-1

  # Set a base name to be used when creating the resources.
  # Note, you will be setting this value for each stack you create, so use a value that will make sense across all the infrastructure.

  # Cluster stack name in the format of `<organization>/<project>/<stack>`
  # Currently requiring that you use the 05-eks-cluster project to deploy the cluster.
  # If you cannot use that project to deploy the cluster, then look at the BYO infratrucutre installer (https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/self-hosted/deployment-options/byo-infra-hosted/)
  clusterStackName: organization/selfhosted-05-ekscluster/prod

  #######
  # IF you deployed the `02-networking` stack, set this value to the name of that stack using the full name (e.g. `organization/02-networking/prod`)
  networkingStackName: organization/selfhosted-02-networking/prod

  ### BRINGING YOUR OWN NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE ###
  ## IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE `02-networking` stack, then remove the `networkingStackName` config item above and instead set the following 
  ## config that would have otherwise been provided by the networking stack.

  ## The vpc ID
  # vpcId: vpc-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
