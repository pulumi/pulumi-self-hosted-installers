  # This should be the same for all the stacks.

  # Currently requiring that you use the 05-eks-cluster project to deploy the cluster.
  # If you cannot use that project to deploy the cluster, then look at the BYO infratrucutre installer (https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/self-hosted/deployment-options/byo-infra-hosted/)

  ### BRINGING YOUR OWN IAM INFRASTRUCTURE ###
  ## IF YOU ARE NOT USING the `01-iam` stack, then remove the `iamStackName` config item above and instead set the following
  ## config that would have otherwise been provided by the iam stack.
  # databaseMonitoringRoleArn: mymonitoringrole

  # IF you deployed the `02-networking` stack, set this value to the name of that stack using the full name (e.g. `organization/02-networking/prod`)

  ### BRINGING YOUR OWN NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE ###
  ## IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE `02-networking` stack, then remove the `networkingStackName` config item above and instead set the following 
  ## config that would have otherwise been provided by the networking stack.
  
  ## This should match the cluster name tagged to the VPC and subnets

  #   - subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
