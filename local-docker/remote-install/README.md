# Remote Installer
This folder contains generic infrastructure management code that does the following:
- Configures the docker host created in the cloud-specific infrastructure to be able to run the local docker installer.
- Runs the local docker installer code that is at the top of this (i.e. `local-docker`) installer folder.
