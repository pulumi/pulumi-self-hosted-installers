# Self-Hosted Pulumi Service Installers

This repository contains installation guides for deploying the [Self-Hosted Pulumi Service](https://www.pulumi.com/product/self-hosted/) into a variety of different target environments.  The components of the Pulumi Service and general guidance on deploying and operating the service are documented in the [Self-Hosted Pulumi Service documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/self-hosted/).  Each guide details how to deploy the set of supporting cloud infrastructure on which the Pulumi Service can run, as well as how to deploy the container images needed to run the Pulumi Service.

The following guides are currently available:
* Quickstart ([Docker Compose](./quickstart-docker-compose))
* AWS ([EKS](./eks-hosted) or [ECS](./ecs-hosted))
* Azure ([AKS](./aks-hosted))
* Docker ([Docker Engine](./local-docker))
* Google Cloud (([GKE](./gke-hosted))
