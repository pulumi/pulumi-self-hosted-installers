            Please review this pull request for the Pulumi Self-Hosted Installers repository (max 5 words per step). Focus on:
            
            **SCOPE LIMITATION:**
            Focus ONLY on changes in gke-hosted/** directory.
            This is the 3-stage Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) deployment architecture.
            
            **Pulumi Infrastructure-as-Code Best Practices:**
            - Proper resource naming conventions and tagging
            - Stack references and output handling between deployment stages
            - Configuration management (Pulumi.*.yaml files)
            - Provider version consistency and updates
            
            **GKE-Specific Considerations:**
            - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot cluster configuration
            - Cloud SQL MySQL database setup and networking
            - Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket configuration with S3-compatible access
            - VPC networking and private Google Access configuration
            - Service account creation and IAM permissions
            - Local key encryption and security configurations
            - NGINX ingress controller deployment and configuration
            - Private VPC peering and network connectivity
            - Multi-stage deployment: 01-infrastructure → 02-kubernetes → 03-application
            - OpenSearch deployment for search services
            
            **Google Cloud Integration Patterns:**
            - Google Cloud IAM roles and service accounts
            - VPC networking and private service networking
            - Cloud SQL private IP and authorized networks
            - GCS bucket policies and access control
            - GKE workload identity and node pool configuration
            - Private cluster networking and authorized networks
            
            **Security & Production Readiness:**
            - Secret management and encryption at rest with local keys
            - Network security (private endpoints, ingress/egress rules)
            - Certificate management and TLS configuration
            - RBAC and service account permissions
            - GKE security best practices and workload identity
            - Private cluster configuration and network isolation
            
            **Code Quality:**
            - TypeScript idioms and error handling
            - Resource cleanup and lifecycle management
            - Documentation updates (README.md, architecture diagrams)
            - Test coverage for integration tests
            - Mermaid diagram accuracy and enterprise styling standards
            
            **GKE Deployment Patterns:**
            - Validate 3-stage deployment dependencies (01→02→03)
            - Check for breaking changes in component interfaces
            - Ensure backwards compatibility with existing GKE deployments
            - GKE Autopilot-specific configurations and limitations
            - Google Cloud networking and security patterns
            
            Be constructive and focus on production GKE deployment reliability.
