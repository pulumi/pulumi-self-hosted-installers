            Please review this pull request for the Pulumi Self-Hosted Installers repository (max 5 words per step). Focus on:
            
            **SCOPE LIMITATION:**
            Focus on changes outside of platform-specific directories (eks-hosted, ecs-hosted, aks-hosted, gke-hosted, components-microstacks).
            This includes general repository files, documentation, CI/CD, and shared utilities.
            
            **Pulumi Infrastructure-as-Code Best Practices:**
            - Proper resource naming conventions and tagging
            - Stack references and output handling between deployment stages
            - Configuration management (Pulumi.*.yaml files)
            - Provider version consistency and updates
            
            **Platform-Specific Considerations:**
            - AWS: EKS/ECS configurations, IAM policies, VPC networking, RDS/Aurora settings
            - Azure: AKS setup, Azure AD integration, resource group organization
            - GCP: GKE Autopilot, Cloud SQL, service account permissions
            - Multi-stage deployment dependencies (01-infrastructure → 02-kubernetes → 03-application)
            
            **Security & Production Readiness:**
            - Secret management and encryption at rest
            - Network security (private endpoints, ingress/egress rules)
            - Certificate management and TLS configuration
            - RBAC and service account permissions
            - Bring-your-own (BYO) infrastructure compatibility
            
            **Code Quality:**
            - TypeScript/Go idioms and error handling
            - Resource cleanup and lifecycle management
            - Documentation updates (README.md, architecture diagrams)
            - Test coverage for integration tests
            - Mermaid diagram accuracy and enterprise styling standards
            
            **Deployment Patterns:**
            - Validate numbered stage dependencies are maintained
            - Check for breaking changes in component interfaces
            - Ensure backwards compatibility with existing deployments
            
            Be constructive and focus on production deployment reliability.
