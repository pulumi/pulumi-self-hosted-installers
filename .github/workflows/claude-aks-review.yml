            Please review this pull request for the Pulumi Self-Hosted Installers repository (max 5 words per step). Focus on:
            
            **SCOPE LIMITATION:**
            Focus ONLY on changes in aks-hosted/** directory.
            This is the 3-stage Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment architecture.
            
            **Pulumi Infrastructure-as-Code Best Practices:**
            - Proper resource naming conventions and tagging
            - Stack references and output handling between deployment stages
            - Configuration management (Pulumi.*.yaml files)
            - Provider version consistency and updates
            
            **AKS-Specific Considerations:**
            - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster configuration
            - Azure AD integration and workload identity
            - Azure Database for MySQL configuration and networking
            - Azure Storage account setup and blob storage
            - Virtual network (VNet) and subnet configuration
            - Key Vault integration for secret management
            - Azure Active Directory service principal and identity management
            - NGINX ingress controller deployment and configuration
            - cert-manager setup for automated certificate management
            - Azure-specific networking and security groups
            - Multi-stage deployment: 01-infrastructure → 02-kubernetes → 03-application
            - OpenSearch deployment and configuration for search services
            
            **Azure Integration Patterns:**
            - Azure resource group organization and naming
            - Azure AD authentication and RBAC integration
            - Azure networking and private endpoints
            - Azure Monitor and logging integration
            - Workload identity federation setup
            - Azure Key Vault secret management
            
            **Security & Production Readiness:**
            - Secret management and encryption at rest
            - Network security (private endpoints, ingress/egress rules)
            - Certificate management and TLS configuration
            - RBAC and service account permissions
            - Azure AD integration and authentication flows
            - Workload identity and managed identity configuration
            
            **Code Quality:**
            - TypeScript idioms and error handling
            - Resource cleanup and lifecycle management
            - Documentation updates (README.md, architecture diagrams)
            - Test coverage for integration tests
            - Mermaid diagram accuracy and enterprise styling standards
            
            **AKS Deployment Patterns:**
            - Validate 3-stage deployment dependencies (01→02→03)
            - Check for breaking changes in component interfaces
            - Ensure backwards compatibility with existing AKS deployments
            - Azure-specific Kubernetes patterns and configurations
            - Ingress and certificate automation workflows
            
            Be constructive and focus on production AKS deployment reliability.
